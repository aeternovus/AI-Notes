        "LangChain is a popular framework that allow users to quickly build apps and pipelines around **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels. It can be used to for chatbots, **G**enerative **Q**uestion-**A**nwering (GQA), summarization, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of the library is that we can _\"chain\"_ together different components to create more advanced use-cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prompt templates**: Prompt templates are, well, templates for different types of prompts. Like \"chatbot\" style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs**: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agents**: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken, tools like web search or calculators can be used, and all packaged into logical loop of operations.\n",

        "1. Models larger than `google/flan-t5-large`, such as `xl` or `xxl`, are timing out.\n",
        "2. Google models can occasionally pick up the linguistic aspects of the prompt, but they may produce factually inaccurate results.\n",
        "3. The OpenAI model provided factually correct answers in this instance. However, in the Pinecone [blog post](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-intro/) from which this code is adapted, the answers were not always accurate. This discrepancy might be due to updates to the OpenAI model. It is advisable to fact-check the information generated by OpenAI models, even when it appears plausible, in order to account for model hallucinations.\n",
        "4. Prompt templates can be a useful tool for structuring prompts. Can be useful if we want to use same outline structure, but just alter few values.\n",
        "5. Prompt templates are apparently supported by both LLMs and chat models.\n",
        "6. In the above examples we can use either `run` or `generate` methods.\n",
        "    * `run` can use used for one prompt at a time. Even if we have multiple questions like in above example we can have all the questions in a single prompt and advanced LLM models like OpenAI `davenci` or `gpt3.5` can pickup these questions and answer them individually.\n",
        "    * or we can use `generate` to generate outputs for a list of prompts."
